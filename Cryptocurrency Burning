What Is Cryptocurrency Burning?
Cryptocurrency burning is the process in which users can remove tokens (also called coins) from circulation,
which reduces the number of coins in use. The tokens are sent to a wallet address
that cannot be used for transactions other than receiving the coins.
The wallet is outside the network, and the tokens can no longer be used.
Now the question is; what is a token burn? Well, token burning doesn’t actually mean dissolving any asset, 
while it practically means that a certain quantity of token is removed from the circulating supply.
So, in simple words, token burning is a process where a few coins or tokens are permanently removed from circulation.
What actually happens is that the tokens are taken out of circulation by sending the signatures to an address eater.
Notably, an address eater is a public address which anyone can view and any asset sent to this address cannot be recovered and used.
The burnt tokens are recorded on the blockchain’s transparent ledger to confirm that the tokens are burned.

Why are tokens burnt?
The simple logic behind the token burning can be related to their value. 
It means that burning the tokens can increase their value; it’s the simple concept of demand and supply. 
Isn’t it? When the number of tokens is reduced, their value will increase because it often leads to strong reactions from the investors.
The prices start to rise because buyers begin to react to it.
**********----------------------
This is the reason why investors are more attracted to such tokens, which undergo periodic token burn.
Let me explain it in simpler words. 
For instance, a company decides to burn their tokens. 
So, the supply of tokens will be reduced after the burn, and by the simple demand and supply logic,
the value of tokens might get appreciated. 
Suppose the token is appreciated by 5%, then the token holder’s investments will automatically be increased and become more valuable.
Although, for yesterday’s BNB token burn, the market still hasn’t reacted to it, and the price of BNB is still decreasing.
